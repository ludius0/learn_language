N-body simulation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation

I have tried to build simple version of simulation. The env is in 3D, but visualization is in 2D.
All bodies have assigned same mass, but with collision on 'True' - one body inherit mass of second one.
You can also assigne borders to 'False' or you can change size of simulation (tied to size of window).
