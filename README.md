# simulations
My experiments with a bunch of simulations. Feel free to browse it or use it.


List of TO-DO:
- n-body (done)
- pendium (2D) with joints
- Ants (with algorithm for quick searching)
- 3D render (of cube) (with rotation) (done)
- 3D Animation of donut (torus)
- Bouncing box (circles collisons)
- Clothes simualtion (2D)
- Angry bird (catapult)
- Chaos theory / equations (ugraded n-body)
- Conway game of life (large scale)
- Fluid simulation (2D)
- Path-finding visualization
- Ray-casting (2D)
- 3D space (made with ray-casting)
- 2D fractals visualization (with procedural generating)
- 3D fractal visualization

Requirements for other projects:
- use / learn pyglet (mainly for 3D)
