# Repo of my projects in programming languages

A repo of my projects that I created when I was learning (a certain) programming language.

The best method that works for me when learning a programming language (and other things) is by doing (at least there's some fun in it).

I make a list of projects I want to do and sort them by estimated difficulty.
