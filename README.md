# Repo of my projects in programming languages

A repo of my projects that I created when I was learning (a certain) programming language. 

The best method that works for me when learning a programming language (and other things) is by doing (at least there's some fun in it). 

I make a list of projects I want to do and sort them by estimated difficulty. 

Once I create a difficult project(s) in certain language (final in the list), then I dont't need to go back and update it, because I will consider myself at least intermediate~advance in that language. That also means if I write a new project in that langugage I probably won't update the list of projects there anymore. 

Also this is a dump for small and petite projects / concepts that I wanted to try or had to. 

Ussualy intermediate / advance projects will have own repository.


My main basic interests:
1. CI (DL, ML and RL) (+ some Data Science)
2. Hardware (Microcontrollers / Robotics / Mechantronics / El. engineering)
3. CS Concepts (algorithms & data structures and math behind it, design of programming languages, cybersecurity and so on....)


Review and Tier List of my experience with programming languages so far (in this repo):
```
Each of programming language is the tool that was develop for some purpose. Best programming languages should enhance programmers when problem solving, making it most robust, quick and simple (best elegant) solution, and beat everyone else in competation (other languages or other programmers). Despite that, all programming languages were created for some purpose, but none of them were created equall and this is my takes on each them and my experience with them.
```
1. Python (S tier) (there isn't better swiss knife)
2. Brainf*ck (Shadow realm tier list)
3. C
4. C#
