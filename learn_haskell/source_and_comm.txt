About Haskell:

Purely functional programming language.
Scripts format is myfunction.hs.
Negative numbers have to be in parenthesis.
Functions are called by typing their name then one space then inputs (can repeat for inputs), except
an infix function, which is called for example like this '92 `div` 10'.
"bar (bar 3)" would be in imperative language (C) something like this "bar(bar(3))."

succ int -> return int+1
min int int -> return the lowest number
max int int -> return the biggest number
