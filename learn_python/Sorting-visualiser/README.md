# Sorting-visualiser

Sorting visualiser made in pygame. Some time ago I wrote on my to-do project list project, which would show how sorting algorithms works and also I would learn more about sorting algorithm. Also I remember, before I started, I once saw code from user fraserlove, who made in really good OOP style (I wasn't experienced enough with OOP -> after this project I am more confident about it), so I tried it also in OOP as challange and I'm happy with result.

First you select sorting algorithm and than watch its performance. If you want to go back to the main menu press 'space'.
