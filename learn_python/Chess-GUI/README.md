# Chess

It's still not great, there are few things that could be abolished and replaced. If I would do it again, I would do it better, but still I'm quit proud of myself. Somewhere in the future I would like to add multiplayer with socket (and pickle) module.

Program is not using any sprites. In unicode there are chess piece that I implemented as chess pieces. I actually needed to download segoe-ui-symbol font to be able to show it with pygame.

Right now program is missing start and end screen. Maybe I won't even bother with adding it, because I want to move to another project and later return to this and program it again from scratch (with multiplayer).
