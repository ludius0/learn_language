# 0-9-number-guesser

**Number Gusser of 0 to 9**

As I was learning and playing with deep learning (and machine learning) I wanted to test my self and make something. In keras is mnist dataset of already labeled pictures of numbers (28x28 size). I used it to create model and rest is only GUI. \
Controls: \
Mouse: \
  left click -> draw \
  right click -> erase \
 Keyboard: \
  space -> load model and guess number (than erase whole display)

In background is board of (1, 28, 28, 1) dimensions, it is list of pixels of your picture you draw (on grid of 28x28 rects/pixels).
There is one added script "create_model.py". If there isn't model in directory with "main.py" or if you want tweak model you can  used that script.

The model isn't best. I found that it straggle if you draw around center and not directly in center; also if you draw big numbers. But overall it work and I'm satisfied with result. 
BTW: The model took me about 30 minutes to train. (GPU: GTX 960; at least I think it used GPU)
