Python was my introduction to programming. That's why this repository looks like this (chaotically).

I'll probably never go back to update these projects. A lot of them aren't complete, but for learning programming that's fine.

These projects used to have their own repositories, but I moved them here (and saved the git logs).

Btw there is probably terrible English.
