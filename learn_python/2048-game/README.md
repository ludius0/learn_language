# 2048-game

I tried copy of the 2048. It was fun and challanging (I tried write tkinter code in oop form). Specially to came up with logic and I had a lot of problems with tkinter (man, it's time to find newer GUI).

Language: python
GUI: tkinter

Keyboard input (with GUI version):
"a" -> up; 
"d" -> left; 
"w" -> up; 
"s" -> down; 
"i" -> end game; 
"p" -> restart game;

Issue: With every move it draw new squares on top of previous (Doesn't cause much issue). End game screen doesn't work properly (I already moved on another project).
