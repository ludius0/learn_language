# Conway-s-game-of-life

My code for Conway's Game of Life.

If you want explore possibilities of the game than I recommend to go here: https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page.

Game has simple rules:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

To draw or erase use a mouse button. With pressing space you start the game. With pressing space again you stop simulation and return it to previous state

In values script you can modify height, width, size of rect ("pixel") and colors.

This challange took me only few houres and I am quit happy with result.
